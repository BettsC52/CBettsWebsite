        <h1>Hi, I am Charles Betts</h1>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p> In 2018 I graduated in BEng Mechanical Engineering and subsequently enrolled for the new MSc
            Industrial
            Digitalisation based at Manchester Metropolitan University’s PrintCity, graduating in 2020 with a Merit.
        </p>
        <p>
            I always had a passion for understanding mechanical assemblies and how they work since I was young, and
            through
            the bachelor's degree, I gained an appreciation for CAD and simulations, creating scenarios and
            investigating
            the effects of both FEA and CFD.
        </p>
        <p>
            With additive manufacturing gaining traction I applied and was accepted to be a part of the MSc Industrial
            Digitalisation degree. This allowed me to continue learning and developing my interests in FEA and CFD while
            learning manufacturing techniques. Gaining an understanding in not only design for additive manufacturing
            techniques including FDM and SLA, but the benefits both new and traditional techniques bring.
        </p>
        <p>
            My year-long project, titled “Part Consolidation of Multi-Component Assemblies” focussed on an assembly, in
            my
            instance a
            baby stroller, and produced a methodology of how to reduce the number of parts to produce an assembly with
            the
            same or better characteristics. The research also investigated the benefits both to product life cycle and
            sustainability. I believe it is important to understand the environmental impact and financial savings to
            both
            business and consumers. More on my dissertation project, including a summary video <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCOxqtAXnGM" target="_blank">
                here,
            </a>
            and a gallery of renders <a href="cadPortfolio.html" target="_blank">

        <p>
            Currently I am pursuing a course in back end development using Python to process large amounts of data and
            website design, as you can see now. As part of my course, my team and I designed a text based game that you
            can see for yourself here.
